# ✈️ My First Data Analysis Project!

**Hi! I'm looking for internships as a fresher Python developer 👋**

This is my airline booking analysis web app that I built to show what I've learned so far! It was pretty challenging but really fun to make. I'm still learning but I'm proud of how it turned out and excited to learn more in a real internship.

I used real airline booking data and made it interactive so you can filter by cities and dates - the charts update automatically which I think is really cool!

## 🎯 What This Project Does

I made an interactive dashboard where you can explore airline booking data! You can:

- **Filter by cities**: Pick departure and destination cities
- **Select date ranges**: Choose which time period to analyze  
- **See popular routes**: Find out which flights people book most
- **Check price trends**: See how ticket prices change over time
- **Find busy days**: Discover which days have the most bookings

## 💻 What I Learned Building This

**Technologies I figured out:**
- **Python basics**: Writing functions, handling errors, organizing code
- **Pandas**: Working with data (this was tricky at first!)
- **Plotly**: Making interactive charts (way cooler than I expected!)
- **Streamlit**: Building web apps (surprisingly easy once I got the hang of it)

**Skills I developed:**
- **Problem solving**: Breaking down the project into smaller pieces I could handle
- **Self learning**: Googling errors and reading documentation (lots of this!)
- **Code organization**: Making my code readable with comments and functions
- **User experience**: Trying to make the app easy and fun to use
