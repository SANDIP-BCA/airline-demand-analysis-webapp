# ✈️ Flight Market Analyzer - Alex Chen's Internship Test Project

**Hi! I'm Alex Chen, applying for the internship position 👋**

This is my submission for the airline booking market demand analysis test project. 
I'm a final year Computer Science student and this was my first time building something 
with web scraping and API integration - really challenging but super fun!

**What my app does:**
- Gets flight booking data from Australian domestic routes
- Uses ChatGPT API to analyze market trends and generate insights
- Interactive dashboard with filters and real-time chart updates
- Analyzes popular routes, pricing patterns, and booking behaviors

Still learning but really proud of how this turned out! Hope it demonstrates 
I can tackle real-world coding challenges.
