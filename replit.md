# ✈️ Airline Booking Market Demand Analysis

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed for analyzing airline booking demand data, built as an internship application project. The application provides interactive dashboards with filtering capabilities, data visualizations, and detailed insights into booking patterns, price trends, and demand forecasting. This project demonstrates essential data analysis skills, clean coding practices, and professional presentation suitable for a fresher developer applying for data analyst internship positions.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Architecture Pattern**: Single-page application with interactive widgets
- **Caching Strategy**: Uses Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` decorator for performance optimization
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for filters

### Backend Architecture
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
- **Visualization Engine**: Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects for interactive charts
- **Date Processing**: Python datetime module for temporal data handling
- **File I/O**: CSV-based data loading with error handling

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: CSV files for airline booking data
- **Data Format**: Structured tabular data with date fields
- **Caching**: In-memory caching through Streamlit decorators

## Key Components

### Data Loading Module
- **Purpose**: Load and preprocess airline booking data from CSV files
- **Features**: Date parsing, route creation, temporal feature engineering
- **Error Handling**: FileNotFoundError handling for missing data files
- **Performance**: Cached data loading to prevent redundant file reads

### Interactive Filter System
- **Origin/Destination Filters**: City-based route filtering
- **Date Range Picker**: Temporal data filtering capabilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant visualization updates based on filter changes

### Visualization Components
- **Bar Charts**: Route popularity and demand pattern analysis
- **Line Charts**: Price trend analysis with min/max ranges
- **Data Tables**: Sortable and filterable tabular views
- **Export Functionality**: CSV download capabilities for filtered datasets

### Analytics Engine
- **Route Analysis**: Popular flight route identification
- **Price Analysis**: Ticket price trend tracking
- **Demand Analysis**: Peak booking period detection
- **Summary Statistics**: Comprehensive metrics dashboard

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: CSV file loaded and cached using Streamlit decorator
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Date parsing and feature engineering (routes, temporal features)
3. **Interactive Filtering**: User selections filter the dataset in real-time
4. **Analysis Processing**: Filtered data processed for various analytical insights
5. **Visualization Rendering**: Charts and tables updated based on processed data
6. **Export Generation**: Filtered datasets available for CSV download

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **plotly**: Interactive visualization library
- **datetime**: Date and time handling

### Data Dependencies
- **airline_data.csv**: Primary data source containing booking information
- **Expected Schema**: booking_date, departure_date, origin, destination, price, passengers

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit-compatible Python environment
- **Requirements**: Standard Python data science stack
- **File Structure**: Single-file application with data dependencies

### Production Considerations
- **Scalability**: Streamlit caching for performance optimization
- **Data Updates**: CSV file replacement for data refresh
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing data files

### Deployment Steps
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Place airline_data.csv in the application root directory
3. Run application using `streamlit run app.py`
4. Access via provided Streamlit URL
